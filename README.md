# Event Related VASO

Due to its high specificity, VASO plays a major role in laminar fMRI. However, its lower sensitivity compared to GE-BOLD has led researchers to mostly employ block-
designs to increase SNR. Here, we developed a VASO sequence with a short TR (895ms volume acquisition) and showed that it provides the means to capture layer-
specific haemodynamic responses with high temporal resolution. During event-related stimulation, we show reliable responses in visual and somatosensory cortices. 
Furthermore, the short TR and high specificity of VASO enabled us to show differences in laminar reactivity, thus demonstrating the high value for event-related 
designs using CBV-based laminar fMRI.

In this repository, we collect resources for data acquisition and processing.
